# TinsPHP - type inference engine

This repository contains the type inference engine of [TinsPHP](https://github.com/tinsphp).  
It is responsible to infer types for PHP code represented as an AST (which was generated by [TinsPHP's parser](https://github.com/tinsphp/tins-parser)) and has to augment the stated AST with the types in order that [TinsPHP's translator](https://github.com/tinsphp/tins-translators-tsphp) can translate PHP code to TSPHP code.

Please visit the [project's website](http://tsphp.ch/tins) for more information on the project.
Use the project's [issue tracking system](http://tsphp.ch/tins/jira) (JIRA) to report bugs or submit feature requests.
